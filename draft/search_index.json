This paper will introduce how to enable the protection mechanisms in UEFI firmware to harden the pre-boot phase.\n\n\n\n\n[1]  [ Tanenbaum] Modern Operating Systems, 4th edition, Andrew S.

It modified the return address on the stack, injected malicious code, then it controlled the system. (See figure 1-1 Stack Smashing Buffer Overflow Attack)\n\nFigure 1-1 Stack Smashing Buffer Overflow Attack (Source: [StackCheck][1] )\nIn 1999, StackCheck was introduced to prevent buffer overflow attack on a stack.[StackCheck][1]> \nWhen the program makes a function call, it puts a random digital canary on top of the return address on the stack. When the function returns, the program checks if the canary data is modified. If it is modified, there must be something wrong and a special failure reporting function is invoked before the program returns back to the function address on the stack. (See figure 1-2 Canary Word Next to Return Address)\n\nFigure 1-2 Canary Word Next to Return Address (Source: [StackCheck][1])\nStack canary is a software feature. It is supported by most compilers.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] [StackCheck] StackGuard: Automatic Adaptive Detection and Prevention of Buffer-Overflow Attacks.

It is enough in preboot phase, but it is a bad idea in OS runtime. If a UEFI runtime module enables stack check, we need figure out a better way to signal the error to operating system. For example, we can use __fastfail to notify OS kernel. “The __fastfail intrinsic provides a mechanism for a fast fail request—a way for a potentially corrupted process to request immediate process termination.”[MSVC_FASTFAIL] [1]If a System Management Mode (SMM) module enables stack check, the fail program cannot use __fastfail directly. It can choose deadloop, reset system, or inject System Control Interrupt (SCI) and do a long jump to a known good point to finish resource cleanup and execute RSM instruction to return to OS, then fail in OS eventually. From a software engineering standpoint, the UEFI Platform Initialization [PI][2]  Specification defines a ReportStatusCode service for SMM, generalized to “MM” for SMM and TrustZone, and DXE, which extends into UEFI runtime. Exception handling code can invoke ReportStatusCode so that a platform can provide market or product-specific behavior, including a while (1) loop that pulses an LED for a closed box client, all the way up to a multi-socket server that might record the result of the failure in a baseboard management controller Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).\nSummary \nThis section introduces the concept of stack canaries and how to enable this feature in EDK II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] [MSVC_FASTFAIL] Microsoft.com- _fastfail,\n[2] [PI] UEFI Platform Initialization Specification, Version 1.5 \n"},"data_execution_protection/":{"url":"data_execution_protection/","title":"Data Execution Protection","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The memory allocation algorithm is top-down. In order to support the randomization in the pre-boot environment, we define below requirement:\n\nThe randomization algorithm should keep UEFI firmware boot behavior consistent. If a system has enough memory for boot, it should be able to boot at any time. If a system is out of memory, it should be out of memory for any boot. If a UEFI firmware boots at some time because the memory is enough, but it may fail at some other time because the randomization cause memory being exhausted, then it is not acceptable solution. This is very important for a resource constrained environment, such as System Management Mode (SMM)  or the Pre-EFI Initialization (PEI) phase.\n\nThe randomization algorithm should keep OS resume from sleep states required memory being consistent. An OS may needs to support S4 or S3 resume feature. The OS resume may have some assumption that some special memory is unchanged, such as the runtime memory, or the ACPI memory.\n\nAny individual component may have its own randomization algorithm. For example, the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), or Page Table are allocated from heap memory. Even if the heap has randomized, the CPU driver can have additional randomization for GDT/IDT/PageTable specifically.\n\n\n"},"address_space_layout_randomization/enable_aslr_for_uefi_in_edkii.html":{"url":"address_space_layout_randomization/enable_aslr_for_uefi_in_edkii.html","title":"Enable ASLR for UEFI in EDK II","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Before the Driver eXecution Environment (DXE) stack is allocated from heap in the Pre-EFI Initialization (PEI) phase, AllocateRandomPages() is called to allocate some random pages to shift the PEI heap.\n\nDxeCore randomization.\nThe DxeCore is also loaded from PEI heap by DxeIplFindDxeCore() https://github.com/jyao1/SecurityEx/blob/master/AslrPkg/Override/MdeModulePkg/Core/DxeIplPeim/DxeLoad.c. AllocateRandomPages() also helps shift the DxeCore memory.\n\nUEFI heap randomization.\nThe heap for DxeCore is reported by PEI and discovered by DxeCore in https://github.com/jyao1/SecurityEx/blob/master/AslrPkg/Override/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Gcd/Gcd.c. After CoreInitializeMemoryServices() adds available memory to UEFI heap, AllocateRandomPages() is called to allocate some random pages to shift the UEFI heap.\n NOTE: The OS aware memory, such as runtime, ACPI, and reserved memory are pre-reserved in PEI phase. They are not impacted by the UEFI heap randomization.\nThe final memory layout in UEFI is shown in figure 3-4.\n\n\n\nFigure 3-4 UEFI memory layout\n\nUEFI image randomization.\nThe UEFI randomized heap shifts are implemented with a fixed offset. As such, even memory allocation shifts occur with the fixed offset. It is not good enough for a Portable Executable (PE) Common Object File Format(COFF)  (PE/COFF) image load.\nFor PE/COFF images we use “image shuffle” to randomize the image load order. Whenever the DxeCore discovers a new firmware volume (FV), the DxeCore unconditionally load all the images in this FV with a random order. See figure 3-5 Image shuffle.\n\n\n\nFigure 3-5 Image Shuffle\nFor example, if a FV contains 4 images – A, B, C, D. The loaded image order in memory is different among the 1st boot, the 2nd boot, and the 3rd boot.\nNow let’s see how the Core shuffles images.\nThe DxeCore maintains the image information in below data structure:\n\nFigure 3-6 Core Image Database\nThe top left most mDiscoveredList is a linked list for all discovered images in the firmware volume. The mScheduledQueue is a subset of mDiscoveredList and mScheduledQueue records the linked list of the image whose dependency is satisfied and ready to run.\nThe pseudo code for current core dispatch is below:\n==============================\n\nScan FV, put to DiscoveredList.\nCheck Apriori, put to Scheduled List.\nWhile (TRUE) {\n  For image in ScheduledList {\n    LoadImage()\n    call entrypoint // StartImage()\n  }\n  Check dependency, put to Scheduled List.\n}\n\n==============================\nWith ASLR capability, the core dispatch logic is updated to below:\n==============================\nScan FV, put to DiscoveredList.\nFor image in DiscoveredList {\n  Copy Information to local cache\n}\nShuffle image order in local cache\nFor image in local cache {\n   LoadImage()\n}\nThe code above is the additional step to implement the image shuffle. The LoadImage() is moved earlier.\nCheck Apriori, put to Scheduled List.\nWhile (TRUE) {\n  For image in ScheduledList {\n    call entrypoint // StartImage()\n  }\n  Check dependency, put to Scheduled List.\n}\n==============================\nThe image shuffle capability is controlled by the Platform Configuration Database (PCD) Variable:  gEfiAslrPkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdImageShuffleEnable(https://github.com/jyao1/SecurityEx/blob/master/AslrPkg/AslrPkg.dec).\nWhen this PCD is TRUE, the DxeCore dispatcher function CoreFwVolEventProtocolNotify()(https://github.com/jyao1/SecurityEx/blob/master/AslrPkg/Override/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Dispatcher/Dispatcher.c) calls DxeCoreLoadImages() to load all images with shuffled order before the dependency section is evaluated, as we discussed above.\nImage shuffle just controls image load, it does not control image start. The image start process is unchanged. DxeCore only starts an image after its dependency is satisfied.\n"},"address_space_layout_randomization/enable_aslr_for_smm_in_edkii.html":{"url":"address_space_layout_randomization/enable_aslr_for_smm_in_edkii.html","title":"Enable ASLR for SMM in EDK II","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

ExecuteSmmCoreFromSmram() (https://github.com/jyao1/SecurityEx/blob/master/AslrPkg/Override/MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/PiSmmIpl.c) allocates the SMRAM for SmmCore, plus the maximum pages needed by randomization. Then it shifts the SmmCore inside of the whole allocated memory. This is designed to meet the requirement 1 – to make sure the SMRAM consumption is consistent.\n\nSMM heap randomization.\nThe SMM heap randomization is handled in https://github.com/jyao1/SecurityEx/blob/master/AslrPkg/Override/MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/Page.c. When a new SMRAM block is found, the SmmAddMemoryRegion() function reserves the some fixed length pages and shift the valid SMRAM inside of whole SMRAM. \nThe same design philosophy can be adopted by any randomization in SMM, such as stack, page table, GDT, IDT, etc. The key is to allocate MAX fixed length pages, and shift content inside of it, in order to ensure that the SMRAM consumption is consistent in every boot.\n\nFigure 3-7 shows the SMM memory layout.\n\nFigure 3-7 SMM memory layout\n\nSMM image randomization.\nSMM image randomization is similar to UEFI image randomization. When PcdImageShuffleEnable is TRUE, the SmmCore dispatcher function SmmDriverDispatchHandler() (https://github.com/jyao1/SecurityEx/blob/master/AslrPkg/Override/MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/Dispatcher.c) calls SmmCoreLoadImages() to load all images with shuffled order before the dependency section is evaluated as we discussed above.\nJust as for UEFI, the SMM image shuffle only controls image load. It does not control image start. The image start process is unchanged. SmmCore only starts an image after its dependency is satisfied.\n\nSMM information leak prevention.\nSMM is considered as an isolated and secure execution environment. We randomize the component in SMM to prevent attacks. However, if the randomized information is exposed, it is considered as an information leak.\nIn the current EDK II, the SmmCore installs an EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL into DXE protocol database for each SMM images. This EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL contains the SMM image base and size information. This is a typical SMM information leak and make SMM image randomization useless.\n\n\nIn order to mitigate this, SmmLoadImage() (https://github.com/jyao1/SecurityEx/blob/master/AslrPkg/Override/MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/Dispatcher.c) installs the EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL into SMM protocol database to make SMM information self-contained.\n"},"address_space_layout_randomization/future_work.html":{"url":"address_space_layout_randomization/future_work.html","title":"Future work","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Insufficient entropy may not be able to resist an attack. Too strong entropy may easily exhaust the memory. We might need more work to see what the best entropy bit is for the different execution environments.\nCurrent AslrPkg just selects some important components for randomization as a sample. We might need to evaluate if we need to randomize more components, such as the core protocol handle database, system table, etc.\nSummary \nThis section introduces the address space layout randomization technique and how to enable different randomization features in EDK II.\n"},"additional_overflow_detection/":{"url":"additional_overflow_detection/","title":"Additional Overflow Detection","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

There is no explicit requirement for System Management Mode (SMM). A Platform Configuration Database (PCD) gUefiCpuPkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCpuSmmStackSize(https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/UefiCpuPkg.dec) defines the SMM stack size for each processor. The default size is 8KiB, and we observed some platforms set it to be 128KiB.\nSince the stack size is not so large, there is risk that stack overflows and overlaps with the data in heap below stack. We need to devise an effective mechanism to detect if the stack is healthy in order to assist the developer in debugging potential issues. To that end we use the stack guard page. See figure 4-1.\n\nFigure 4-1 StackGuard for Overflow Detection\nThe core marks the last page in the bottom of stack as a “GuardPage”, which works as a guard. The GuardPage is set be NOT PRESENT in the page table. When the stack overlaps with the GuardPage, an exception will be triggered.\nAn interesting thing is that if the current stack is NOT PRESENT, the CPU cannot push the error code and architecture status (CS/RIP/RFLAGS/SS/RSP) to the current stack. The core must setup a special exception stack for the exception handler, which is the “ExceptionStack”. This page is reserved separately and only used by the exception handler. It guarantees the stack is always valid when an exception happens. For a multi-processor system, each processor has its own stack, its own guard page and its own exception stack.\nIn IA32 protected mode, the core sets up an exception task state segment (TSS) and puts the exception TSS segment in the page fault exception entry. This is done so that when the exception happens, the CPU does a task switch to the new stack. In X64 long mode, the core just reuses the TSS and sets up the IST bit in the page fault exception entry to indicate a stack switch.\nIn SMM, this stack guard feature is already done in https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm and controlled by PCD  gUefiCpuPkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCpuSmmStackGuard in https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/UefiCpuPkg.dec\nIn UEFI, this stack guard feature is done in https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/DxeIplPeim and controlled by PCD gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCpuStackGuard in https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dec. If the PcdCpuStackGuard is TRUE, the DxeIpl clears the PRESENT bit in the page table for the guard page of the BSP stack. The guard page of the AP stack is initialized in CpuDxe driver, https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/Library/MpInitLib/DxeMpLib.c by using DXE service SetMemorySpaceAttributes().\nBesides CPU driver, the CpuExceptionHandlerLib (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/UefiCpuPkg/Library/CpuExceptionHandlerLib) is also updated to support Stack Overflow detection. The new API – InitializeCpuExceptionHandlersEx() is introduced to initialize the exception TSS. InitializeCpuExceptionHandlersEx()is invoked by DxeCore to setup the exception TSS for the Boot Strap Processor (BSP), and InitializeCpuExceptionHandlersEx()is invoked by CpuDxe driver to setup the exception TSS for the Application Processor (AP).\n"},"additional_overflow_detection/heap_management_in_edkii.html":{"url":"additional_overflow_detection/heap_management_in_edkii.html","title":"Heap Management in EDKII","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The UEFI driver or application may call AllocatePages/FreePages/AllocatePool/FreePool to allocate or free the resource, or call GetMemoryMap() to review all of the memory usage.\n[Heap Initialization]\nWhen DxeIpl transfers control to the DxeCore, all of the resource information is reported in a Hand-off-Block (HOB) [PI][1] list. The DxeCore constructs the heap based upon the HOB information. See figure 4-2 Heap Initialization.\n\nThe DxeCore needs to find one region to serve as the initial memory in CoreInitializeMemoryServices()https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Gcd/Gcd.c). The function is responsible for priming the memory map so that memory allocations and resource allocations can be made. If the memory region described by the Phase Handoff Information Table (PHIT) HOB is big enough to hold BIN and minimum initial memory, this memory region is used as highest priority. It can make the memory BIN allocation to be at the same memory region with PHIT that has better compatibility to avoid memory fragmentation. Usually the BIN size is already considered by platform Pre-EFI  Initialization Module (PEIM) when the platform PEIM calls InstallPeiMemory() to PEI core.\n\nThen the DxeCore allocates runtime memory for EFI system table and runtime services table. It triggers BIN initialization in CoreAddMemoryDescriptor() (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Mem/Page.c), when mMemoryTypeInformationInitialized is FALSE. The memory type information HOB is consumed to pre-allocate memory region for each memory type defined in this HOB. [MemMap] described the purpose and usage of the BIN.\n\nOther small DXE service allocation also happed in this region, before full memory is ready. For example, CoreInitializeImageServices() installs EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL for DxeCore, so that we can have an Image Handle for DxeCore, which will be used for Global Coherency Domain (GCD).\n\nNow DxeCore CoreInitializeGcdServices() (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Gcd/Gcd.c) needs figure out all memory and IO resources, add them to mGcdMemorySpaceMap and mGcdIoSpaceMap. The tested memory is marked as EfiGcdMemoryTypeSystemMemory or EfiGcdMemoryTypeMoreReliable. The other memory is marked to be EfiGcdMemoryTypeReserved or EfiGcdMemoryTypePersistentMemory. After the GCD memory map is constructed, the DxeCore calls CoreAddMemoryDescriptor() to add all EfiGcdMemoryTypeSystemMemory and EfiGcdMemoryTypeMoreReliable. Now all available memory is ready for use.\n\nThe last step in CoreInitializeGcdServices() is to relocate the HOB List to an allocated pool buffer. The relocation should be at after all the tested memory resources are added because the memory resource found in CoreInitializeMemoryServices() may have not enough remaining resource for the HOB List.\n\n\nNow the DxeCore heap initialization is done. The rest of DxeCore and any drivers may use the UEFI services AllocatePages/AllocatePool to allocate a chunk of memory. The DxeCore uses the below priority in FindFreePages() to find a free memory location.\n*   If the memory type matches the one described in the memory type information, the memory in BIN is used as first priority.\n\n*   If the memory type is not in memory type information, or there is no enough memory in the pre-allocated BIN, the DxeCore looks for the free memory with top-down algorithm.\n\n*   If there is not enough memory, the DxeCore does a special **“memory promotion”**. `PromoteMemoryResource()`([https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Mem/Page.c](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Mem/Page.c)) is called to add UNTESTED memory region to be system memory. Then `FindFreePages()` tries to find some free memory again.\n\n    In the late DXE/BDS phase, there might be a memory test driver, such as [https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/MdeModulePkg/Universal/MemoryTest](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/MdeModulePkg/Universal/MemoryTest), to test all untested memory and add them to the memory map. After this point all the memory is added to UEFI memory map.\n\nFigure 4-2 Heap Initialization\n[Page Management]\nAfter the heap is initialized, the DxeCore maintains a list of memory map entries. See figure 4-3 Page management. This is a linked list with the memory addresses in ascending order. It contains memory address, length, type and attribute at the page level. When the UEFI service GetMemoryMap() is called, the contents of this linked list are returned, together with other Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO) with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute and the reserved memory in the GCD resource list.\n\nFigure 4-3 Page Management\nWhen gBS-&gt;AllocatePages() is called, CoreInternalAllocatePages() calls FindFreePages() to find out which address can be allocated. The gMemoryMap linked list is traversed in CoreFindFreePagesI()(https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Mem/Page.c). If the Type of an entry is EfiConventionalMemory, and the Length field of the entry is larger than the requested length, and the Start field of the entry is the highest, then the target allocated address is found in this entry. At this point CoreInternalAllocatePages()calls CoreConvertPages() to update this memory map linked list entry.\nThe original entry which contains the target allocated address will be separated (or CLIP operation will occur) into 2 or more entries because the memory type is now different.\n\nFigure 4-4.1 Page Management – Clip: Step 1\nBesides the gMemoryMap linked list, there are 2 data structures involved in the CLIP. mMapStack contains 6 MEMORY_MAP entries as a global variable. mFreeMemoryMapEntryList maintains a list of unused MEMORY_MAP entries. The details of the “CLIP” process is shown at figure 4-4.1 ~ 4-4.5.\nStep 1: The CoreConvertPagesEx() discovers which memory map entry (the GREEN one) contain the target allocated address.\n\nFigure 4-4.2 Page Management – Clip: Step 2\nStep 2: The content of this target MEMORY_MAP entry is updated to contain the part of reset memory after allocation. If the allocated memory is in the middle of the entry, one entry (the YELLOW one) in mMapStack is popped and added to the memory map linked list. This entry covers the rest of memory. This new MEMORY_MAP entry must be from mMapStack because we are not able to allocate memory again in the allocate process. We cannot get an entry from mFreeMemoryMap, because this linked list might be empty at that time.\n\n# Figure 4-4.3 Page Management – Clip: Step 3\nStep 3: CoreConvertPagesEx() calls CoreAddRange() to add the new MEMORY_MAP entry to the memory map linked list. This new entry contains the allocated memory information. For the same reason listed earlier, this entry is also from mMapStack.\n\nFigure 4-4.4 Page Management – Clip: Step 4\nStep 4: Last but not of least importance, CoreConvertPagesEx() calls CoreFreeMemoryMapStack() to move the MEMORY_MAP entry from mMapStack to pool. CoreFreeMemoryMapStack()calls AllocateMemoryMapEntry() to dequeue a MEMORY_MAP entry (the RED one) from mFreeMemoryMapEntryList. It copies the content to the new entry and finds the correct insertion location with ascending order. The memory allocation may occur in AllocateMemoryMapEntry() if the mFreeMemoryMapEntryList is empty.\n\nFigure 4-4.5 Page Management – Clip: Step 5\nStep 5: Finally, after all entries from mMapStack are moved to pool, the memory map linked list CLIP is finished. The mMapStack is kept unchanged. The mFreeMemoryMapEntry is updated.\nLater, when FreePages() happens, 2 or more MEMORY_MAP entries can be merged into one. The unused MEMORY_MAP entries are returned to mFreeMemoryMapEntryList. Those entries can be used in a subsequent AllocatePages().\n[Pool Management]\nBesides page management, DxeCore maintains the pool. A typical UEFI driver or application calls gBS-&gt;AllocatePool() for memory allocation.\nDxeCore assigns one mPoolHead for each UEFI specification defined memory type (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Mem/Pool.c). Each mPoolHead includes a set of FreeList. Each FreeList is a linked list for the fixed size free pool. The size of each FreeList is defined in mPoolSizeTable. It is a Fibonacci sequence, which allows us to migrate blocks between bins by splitting them up, while not wasting too much memory. See figure 4-5 Pool Management.\n\nFigure 4-5 Pool Management\nWhen gBS-&gt;AllocatePool() is called, CoreInternalAllocatePool() calls CoreAllocatePoolI () to find out which FreeList should be used. If the requested pool size is too big to fit in all FreeList, a PoolPage is allocated and returned directly. The FreeList is untouched.\nIf the requested pool size matches one of the FreeList, one entry in this FreeList is dequeued and returned as the free memory.\nIf the matched FreeList is empty, CoreAllocatePoolI() checks the bins holding larger blocks, and will CARVE one. The detail “CARVE” process is shown at figure 4-6.1 ~ 4-6.2.\n\nFigure 4-6.1 Pool Management – Carve: Step 1\nStep 1: If the matched FreeList is empty (such as FreeList[2]), CoreAllocatePoolI() increments the Index of FreeList one by one and checks if the next FreeList is empty. If there is one FreeList that is not empty (such as FreeList[3]), one POOL_FREE entry in this linked list is dequeued (the GREEN one) and goes to the CARVE process.\nIf there is no available entry in all FreeList, CoreAllocatePoolI() calls CoreAllocatePoolPages() to allocate new pages as the candidate and goes to the CARVE process.\n\nFigure 4-6.2 Pool Management – Carve: Step 2\nStep 2: Since the size of this POOL_FREE candidate entry is bigger than the one requested, CoreAllocatePoolI() records the requested entry (the RED one) and splits up the remaining space (the GREEN one) into free pool blocks (such as FreeList[1]). The head of the request entry is changed from POOL_FREE to POOL_HEAD to record the pool information, such as size and type.\nLater, when FreePool() is called, the information in POOL_HEAD can be used to discover into which FreeList it should be returned. If the pool size is too big to fit in all FreeList, it is a PoolPage and freed by CoreFreePoolPages(). Alternately, this POOL_HEAD is converted to POOL_FREE and is inserted into one of the proper FreeList. CoreFreePoolI() also makes an additional check to see if all the pool entries in the same page as Free are freed pool entries. If so, all of these pool entries are removed from the free loop lists, and CoreFreePoolPages() is called to free the entire pages.\n\n\n\n\n[1][PI] UEFI Platform Initialization Specification, Version 1.5 \n"},"additional_overflow_detection/heap_overflow_detection_for_page.html":{"url":"additional_overflow_detection/heap_overflow_detection_for_page.html","title":"Heap Overflow Detection (for Page)","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

[WindowsHeap][1]discussed some machenisms to detect heap overflow.\nIn EDK II, we may setup a guard page around the allocated pages. The concept is similar to the guard page for stack. The gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHeapGuardPageType indicates which type page allocation need guard page. The gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHeapGuardPoolType indicates which type pool allocation need guard page. The gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHeapGuardPropertyMask is a mask to control Heap Guard behavior. All these Platform Configuration Database (PCDs) are defined in https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dec.\nIf heap guard for page allocation is enabled, whenever there is an AllocatePage() request, the core allocates 2 more pages. One page is before the allocated pages and the other is after. Both are set be NOT PRESENT in the page table. If the overflow happens, the page fault exception is triggered immediately. See figure 4-7.\n\nFigure 4-7 HeapGuard for Page Overflow Detection\nThis enhancement is in https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Mem/Page.c. If the IsPageTypeToGuard() returns TRUE, CoreInternalAllocatePages() uses CoreConvertPagesWithGuard() to allocate 2 more pages and calls SetGuardForMemory(). The later calls SetGuardPage() twice to set the guard page before and after. SetGuardPage() calls SetMemoryPageAttributes() to clear PRESENT flag.\nIn the last step, SetGuardForMemory() calls SetGuardedMemoryBits() to mark the memory range as guarded. This bitmask will be checked in UnsetGuardForMemory() when FreePages() is called.\nCare must be taken to avoid the re-entry issue. This re-entry risk stems from the fact that SetMemoryPageAttributes() may need to split a page table entry, which in turn needs to call the AllocatePages() API again. The global variable mOnGuarding is used to record the protection state.\nOne interesting feature for AllocatePages() is that the pages can be freed partially. Figure 4-8 shows a possible AllocatePages/FreePages sequence. AdjustMemoryF() is used to adjust the start address and number of pages to free according to Guard. The purpose of this function is to keep the shared Guard page with adjacent memory block if it's still in guard, or free it if no more sharing. Another purpose is to reserve pages as Guard pages in partial page free situation.\n\nFigure 4-8 HeapGuard in Partial Page Free\nGuarded Heap Map:\nIn order to track if a page is guarded or not, the core defines a guarded memory bitmap table. To simplify the access and reduce the memory used for this table, the table is constructed in the similar way as page table structure but in reverse direction, i.e. from bottom growing up to top. See Figure 4-9.\n\nFigure 4-9 Guarded Heap Map\nThis table uses 1 bit to track 1 page. 1 UINT64 entry tracks 256K memory. 1024 UINT64map table tracks 256M memory. The 5 levels of table can track any address of memory in 64bit system.\nFor a system with 4G memory, two levels of tables can track the whole memory, because two levels (L3+L4) of map tables have already covered 37-bit of memory address. That means we just need 1-page (L3) + 2-page (L4) memory (3 pages) to track the memory allocation works. In this case, there's no need to setup L0-L2 tables. Figure 4-10 shows a real example on how to get the guarded page info from an address.\n\nFigure 4-10 Guarded Heap Map (example)\nGiven the memory address 0x6DFFD000, the L3 table index is first 4 bits, the L4 table index is the 10 bits followed by. The corresponding guarded heap entry in L4 table index 0x37F – 0xB19CAF0B. The bit offset is the 6 bits followed by L4 table index. In this case, it is 0x3D. Since bit 0x3D of 0xB19CAF0B is 1, we can know the page 0x6DFFD000 is guarded.\nThe guarded heap map management is at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Mem/HeapGuard.c. mGuardedMemoryMap is the pointer to table tracking the Guarded memory with bitmap, mMapLevel is the Current depth level of map table pointed by mGuardedMemoryMap. SetGuardForMemory() is to set head Guard and tail Guard for the given memory range.UnsetGuardForMemory() is to clear head Guard and tail Guard for the given memory range.\n\n\n\n\n[1][WindowsHeap] Preventing the exploitation of user mode heap corruption vulnerabilities, 2009\n"},"additional_overflow_detection/heap_overflow_detection_for_pool.html":{"url":"additional_overflow_detection/heap_overflow_detection_for_pool.html","title":"Heap Overflow Detection (for Pool)","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

What about pool?\nIf the pool guard is enabled, each pool allocation becomes the page allocation with the guarded page. Because the pool size might not be a multiple of the page size, we can only set guard page at the head of pool or at the tail of pool. This behavior is controlled by BIT7 of gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHeapGuardPropertyMask. By default the returned pool is near the tail guard page to check overflow. If the BIT7 is set, the returned pool is near the head guard page to check underflow. See figure 4-11.\n\nFigure 4-11 HeapGuard for Pool Overflow Detection\nThis enhancement for the guarded pool is in https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Mem/Pool.c. If the IsPoolTypeToGuard() returns TRUE, CoreAllocatePoolI() uses CoreAllocatePoolPagesI() directly to allocate pages for pool with the guarded pages. In the last step, SetGuardForMemory() is invoked to set the guard page around the allocated pool.\n"},"additional_overflow_detection/null_pointer_protection_in_edkii.html":{"url":"additional_overflow_detection/null_pointer_protection_in_edkii.html","title":"NULL Pointer Protection in EDK II","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

However, in x86 systems, the zero address is valid address in legacy BIOS because the 16bit interrupt vector table (IVT) is at address zero. In current UEFI firmware, zero address is always mapped.\nWe can do some enhancement here. Once the 16bit legacy support is dropped in UEFI firmware, it is possible to mark the first 4K page at address zero to be invalid for X86 system. Then, we can catch the zero address reference if a program does not check memory allocation successful or not.\nSince Compatible Support Module(CSM) or legacy boot needs to be disabled for OS compliance when using UEFI Secure Boot, few systems are seen in the market requiring this memory to be mapped at zero.\nWe define a gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdNullPointerDetectionPropertyMask(https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dec). If the BIT0 of PcdNullPointerDetectionPropertyMask is set, the https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/DxeIplPeim clears the PRESENT bit of the address zero page. As such, a Page Fault exception will be generated if some program access to address zero. The BIT1 of PcdNullPointerDetectionPropertyMask controls the NULL pointer detection in System Management Mode (SMM) environment, it is referred by https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm. The BIT7 ofPcdNullPointerDetectionPropertyMask disables NULL pointer detection just after EndOfDxe. This is a workaround for those unsolvable NULL access issues in OptionROM, boot loader, etc. It can also help to avoid unnecessary exception caused by legacy memory (0-4095) access after EndOfDxe, such as Windows 7* boot on QEMU*. BIT7 is checked by https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe.\n"},"additional_overflow_detection/read-only_page_table.html":{"url":"additional_overflow_detection/read-only_page_table.html","title":"Read-only page table","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

If the heap pool guard is enabled, each AllocatePool() becomes AllocatePages(). Even 1 byte allocation need 12K memory. The heap guard feature will increase memory consumption and may cause memory out of resource. Especially, the System Management Mode (SMM) code runs in the limited System Management Mode RAM (SMRAM) (4M or 8M).\nWe have observed SMRAM out of resource when this feature is turned on. The solution could be:\n\nEnlarge SMRAM\nEnable the partial of PageGuard or PoolGuard feature, via gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHeapGuardPageType and gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHeapGuardPoolType PCD.\nEnable feature one-by-one. The user can build 2 or more BIOS images, and each image include a subset of full features. For example, if the user wants to detect overflow in USB drivers, there is no need to include network drivers.\n\n\nPerformance\nIf the heap guard is enabled, the CPU driver need update the page table for every AllocatePool(), flush translation lookaside buffer (TLB). It brings overhead.\nWe have observed the performance downgrade in UEFI Shell, such as the DEVTREE command or shell script.\nSome of the performance drop can be resolved by removing the page table synchronization from Boot Strap Processor (BSP) to Application Processors (AP)s. When BSP wakes up APs later, the page table is always rewritten. Paging synchronization is unnecessary.\n\nPEI Phase\nThe guard in Pre-EFI Initialization (PEI) phase is not supported yet, because most Intel&reg Architecture (IA) platforms only supports 32bit PEI and paging is not enabled.\nFrom technical perspective, we can add paging-based guard after the permanent memory is initialized in PEI. Stack guard, heap guard or NULL pointer detection can be enabled.\nBefore the permanent memory is initialize, if we need enabling paging, we can only set paging table on A) Flash Region with Access and Dirty bit set. B) Cache as Ram. C) Static RAM. #A can only support read-only paging, while #B and #C has size limitation.\nIn the EDK II community, Brian Johnson also provided another way to enable the NULL pointer detection (https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=687). We can set “the GDT descriptor for the data segment from a \"extend up\" type based at 0, to an \"extend down\" type with a limit of 0. This disables access to the 4k page at 0 due to the way the limit math works with \"extend down\" descriptors.”\n\nPool Underflow/Overflow detection\nFor heap pool detection, we cannot enable both underflow and overflow detection in one image, because the guard page must be 4K aligned and the allocated pool is either adjacent to head guard page or tail guard page.\nIn order to detect underflow and overflow, the user must build 2 different images with BIT7 of gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHeapGuardPropertyMask set or cleared.\n\nEmulation Environment\nCurrent emulation environment (such as NT32) does not have capability to modify CPU page table directly. As such we are not able to enable such page table based protection.\nIn the future, we may be able to set up memory for NT32 application process and then use this function to change page protections for pages within that process to match what we have done for the real hardware. \nFor example: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366898(v=vs.85).aspx]\n\n BOOL WINAPI VirtualProtect(\n _In_  LPVOID lpAddress,\n _In_  SIZE_T dwSize,\n _In_  DWORD  flNewProtect,\n _Out_ PDWORD lpflOldProtect\n );\nFlNewProtect values: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366786(v=vs.85).aspx]\n\n\n"},"additional_overflow_detection/compatibility_consideration.html":{"url":"additional_overflow_detection/compatibility_consideration.html","title":"Compatibility Consideration","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

We notice that the fragmentation may cause OS boot or installation fail. For example, Windows Boot Manager sets the maximum number of global memory descriptor for a 64-bit UEFI system at 512. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020050/blinitializelibrary-failed-xxx-error-when-you-install-or-start-an-oper)\nFor NULL pointer detection, BIT7 of PcdNullPointerDetectionPropertyMask(disables NULL pointer detection just after EndOfDxe) is a workaround for those unsolvable NULL access issues in Option ROM, OS boot loader, such as Windows 7* boot on Qemu*.\n\n3rd part driver (PCI Option ROM)\nWhen the heap guard is enabled, we observed the #PF (Page Fault) exception happens and the instruction address is within a 3rd part PCI Option ROM.\n\nLegacy Compatible Support Module (CSM)\nThe legacy CSM module may need access the zero address and the first 4KiB memory, such as  Interrupt Vector Table(IVT) and  BIOS Data Area (BDA). Whenever the legacy module accesses the first 4KiB memory, the code must be included by ACCESS_PAGE0_CODE() macro. (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/IntelFrameworkPkg/Include/Protocol/LegacyBios.h). For example, when the LegacyBios driver accesses IVT region (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/IntelFrameworkModulePkg/Csm/LegacyBiosDxe/Thunk.c) or when the LegacyKeyboard driver accesses BDA region (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/IntelFrameworkModulePkg/Csm/BiosThunk/KeyboardDxe/BiosKeyboard.c).\nThe platform specific LegacyBiosPlatform driver also need update to add ACCESS_PAGE0_CODE() macro around the code to update IVT or BDA.\n\n CPU driver\n The EDK II DxeCore relies on CPU driver EFI_CPU_ARCH_PROTOCOL.SetMemoryAttributes(https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdePkg/Include/Protocol/Cpu.h) to update the page table (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/CpuDxe/CpuPageTable.c). The EDK II PiSmmCore also relies on PiSmmCpu driver EDKII_SMM_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTE_PROTOCOL(https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Include/Protocol/SmmMemoryAttribute.h)to update the page table (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/SmmCpuMemoryManagement.c). If a platform uses its own CPU driver instead of the open source one, this platform need add the page table update capability in the CPU driver.\n\n\n"},"additional_overflow_detection/call_for_action.html":{"url":"additional_overflow_detection/call_for_action.html","title":"Call for action","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

On the software front, language-based security may offer some relief. This can span using a safer variant of C [CHECKED__C] [1] to refactoring code to a type-safe language [RUST][2]. These are huge tasks, though, given the existing software catalog and would challenge software portability. As such, a language-based approach is not a near term option.\nAs we go from software to hardware, though, one option appears feasible. Specifically, recent hardware advances include the Intel® Memory Protection Extensions (Intel® MPX). This is a new capability introduced into Intel Architecture [IA32SDM][3][MPX][4]. Intel MPX can help detect the buffer overflow or underflow with a set of new Intel® MPX instructions and the compiler support. When Intel® MPX is enabled, a Bounds Table is constructed to store the pointer value, lower bound of the buffer, and the upper bound of the buffer. See figure 4-12.\nThe BNDMKinstruction can create LowerBound (LB) and UpperBound (UB) in bounds register. The BNDCL/BNDCU/BNDCN instruction can check the address of a memory reference or address against the LB or UB. A BOUND Range Exceeded exception (#BR) is raised if any of the bounds compare instructions fail.\nIntel® MPX need compiler support. Microsoft MSVC 2015* Update 1 and GCC 5.1* supports Intel MPX.\n\nFigure 4-12 Bound Table, (source: [MPX][4]\nIntel® MPX may also be considered to add to a UEFI firmware to help catch the heap pool overflow or the global variable overflow.\nSummary \nThis section discussed some other mechanism which can be used to detect stack overflow or heap overflow in EDK II.\n\n\n\n\n[1][CHECKED__C] Checked C \n[2] [RUST] Rust language\n[3][IA32SDM]Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual\n[4][MPX] Intel® Memory Protection Extensions Enabling Guide \n"},"summary/":{"url":"summary/","title":"Summary","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
